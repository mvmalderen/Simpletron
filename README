This project aims to create an emulator for an imaginary computer called the Simpletron.
The Simpletron understands only one language directly, namely the SML: Simpletron Machine Language.
The emulator provides a loader that allows the user two load self-written SML programs into a Simpletron
machine's memory. Once it is there, it can be executed. More information on how to write SML programs can be
found in the SML_reference.txt file.
